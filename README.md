JavaScript is the language for adding interactivity to a website, but there's so much more it can do. Enter Node.js and Express.js, two technologies that extend the capabilities of JavaScript. The Node platform allows you to develop server-side applications with JavaScript that you can then easily publish as websites with the Express framework. In this course, Ray Villalobos walks through the entire process of creating a website on a server with Node.js and Express.js. After going over the installation process, Ray shows how to build a basic application, control the state of an application with routing, and use templates and partials. Then he demonstrates how to quickly structure a site with Express Generator, work with models and views, and publish the final website using Heroku.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
